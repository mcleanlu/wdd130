                <h3>The Salmon River</h3>

                <p>The Salmon River winds its way deep within the Candid Church Wilderness. The people who lived next to
                    this body of water gave it the name "The River of No Return", because so many people fell in love
                    with its rugged beauty that has stood as testament for thousands of years.</p>
                <p>Bears and bighorn sheep are frequently spotted on the hillsides surrounding the river, where herds of
                    elk and deer graze. Ponderosa pines, which tower over the sandy campsites, provide shade from the
                    sun or rain while in harmony with the river corridor.</p>
                <p>The rapids are an adventure to experience!The Salmon is one of the longest rivers in the United
                    States that has not been damaged. In the early summer, the water is higher, faster, and colder than
                    in a free-flowing river. In the late summer, it is lower, slower, and warmer.There are good rapids
                    throughout the summer, but families with children tend to prefer the slower and warmer water in the
                    late summer.</p>
