    <h3>My skills in Project Management</h3>
    <p>
      Data-Driven, Detail-Oriented, Problem Solver <br> <br>

      I understand what it means to build projects and organisation that is high-quality, cohesive, and scalable. I feel
      at ease working with data scientists, engineers, creatives & other business-oriented individuals. I can
      appropriately approach problem-solving and actively maintain a holistic viewpoint through various phases. <br>
      <br>

      I have built a repertoire with engineering, data, analytics, internet marketing, conversion optimization, and UX.
      These experiences have given me unique insights into the product lifecycle and has allowed me to think through the
      entire customer journey while challenging our own assumptions. <br> <br>

      On top of the experience I have had, I apply these life lessons to my methodology approach to cybersecurity and
      bridge that complex world into a tangible concept for many business professionals. <br> <br>
