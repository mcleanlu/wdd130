            <h3>My skills in Cybersecurity</h3>
            <p>
                As an Engineer of Computer Science, I have placed emphasis on the study of programmed algorithms, data
                structures,
                security architecture, and systematic organisation. I have pursued a long emphasis in Cyber security and
                Digital
                Forensics that have lead me to research new avenues of innovation in the developing world of data
                analytics, block
                chain, AI, and bridging all fields with the common assurance of cyber safety. <br> <br>

                As a Security analysts, I monitor, prevent, and stop attacks on all levels of private data. I am a
                digital
                professional who creates and implements firewalls and software systems that automate safety nets for
                both small
                and large infrastructures. <br> <br> </p>
